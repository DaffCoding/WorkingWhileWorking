Each challenge is organized into a separate folder within the repository. Within each folder, you'll find the following files:

- **problem.md:** This file contains the original prompt for the challenge, including any sample inputs and expected outputs.
- **solution.kt or solution.java:** This file contains my implementation of the challenge, written in Kotlin or Java.

## Testing

Each solution includes a set of test cases that can be run to verify the correctness of the implementation. These tests can be run using any testing framework that's compatible with Kotlin and/or Java.
